Lib Manager {#lib_manager}
===========

## Overview

The lib\_manager library provides functionality to dynamically manage libraries in MARS. Note that  plugins in MARS have to be loaded and are handled as libraries.

To be used with a [Libmanager](@ref mars::lib_manager::LibManager), all libraries (and thus, plugins) have to implement the interface [LibInterface](@ref mars::lib_manager::LibInterface) specified in this library.
